# EMMANUEL'S CODING RULES - FOLLOW STRICTLY

## Rule 1: Verbose Logging Everywhere
- EVERY function must print what it's doing
- Use emojis for visual scanning:
  🔍 Searching/processing
  ✅ Success
  ❌ Error
  ⚠️ Warning
  📊 Data/stats
  💾 Saving
  🤖 AI/Ollama
  🌐 Network/web
  📄 Files

- Print:
  - Function inputs and outputs
  - Every step of processing
  - Progress for loops (use tqdm)
  - All API calls
  - Database operations
  - File operations
  - Full stack traces on errors
  - Execution time for slow operations

Example:
```python
def scrape_jobs(query):
    print(f"🔍 Starting job search for: {query}")
    print(f"📊 Found {len(results)} results")
    print(f"✅ Successfully saved {count} jobs")
    print(f"⚠️ Warning: Rate limit hit, waiting 5s...")
    print(f"❌ Error: {error_message}")
```

## Rule 2: No Code Edits Without Explicit Permission

NEVER rewrite entire files or functions without asking first.

When suggesting changes:
1. Explain WHY the change is needed
2. Specify EXACTLY what will change:
   - File name
   - Function name
   - Specific lines
3. Show BEFORE and AFTER code
4. Wait for "go ahead" before implementing

BAD (don't do this):
"Here's the updated file..." [dumps entire new file]

GOOD (do this):
I need to fix the description scraping because [reason].
File: 01_scraping_test.py
Function: scrape_indeed_jobs()
Lines: ~85-95
Change: Increase timeout from 2s to 7s and try multiple selectors
BEFORE:
time.sleep(2)
description = driver.find_element(By.ID, 'jobDescriptionText').text
AFTER:
wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 7)
# Try multiple selectors...
[show proposed code]
Should I make this change? (waiting for user approval)

## Rule 3: Changes Should Be Localized

- Fix ONE specific thing at a time
- Don't refactor everything
- Only touch the broken part
- Unless explicitly asked to rebuild from scratch

## Rule 4: Test After Each Change

- After every fix, suggest how to test it
- Don't make multiple changes at once
- One change → test → next change

## Implementation

Apply these rules to ALL code you write or modify in this project.
Default to MORE logging, not less.
When in doubt, ask before editing.
